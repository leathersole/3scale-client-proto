= A prototype of 3scale client

The purposes of this project are:

* Test whether a 3scale product is integrated with a OIDC IdP.
* Be illustrative how 3scale API gateway, IdP and client interact.

== Features

* Pull products and aplications list from 3scale Management API
* Login to OpenID Connect Identity Provider
* Request to 3scale API gateway

=== What does not this project do?

* This project doesn't aim to perform complex interaction with 3scale API Gateway. You can use link:https://www.postman.com/[Postman] for the purpose.
* Checking secureness is out of scope. i.e. This application logs information like access tokens, and this doesn't check TLS certificates.

=== Limitations

* This project is just a prototype. There's no error handling or no test code. If there is a need, we may create a client that is easier to use based on the user's opinion.

== Tested environments

* This project is tested on link:https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] 14.3.0
